FlatCAM: 2D Computer-Aided PCB Manufacturing
============================================

(c) 2014-2016 Juan Pablo Caram

FlatCAM is a program for preparing CNC jobs for making PCBs on a CNC router.
Among other things, it can take a Gerber file generated by your favorite PCB
CAD program, and create G-Code for Isolation routing.


Note: I created this fork, because the original project seems to be abandoned.
I will try to make this ready to work on modern Linux distributions again
but this is work in progress. If the original author decides to continue
maintaining the project, I am happy to provide my changes to the upstream.
